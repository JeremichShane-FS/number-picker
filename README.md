# Number Picker

You can find the deployed project at [Number Picker](https://jeremichshane-fs.github.io/number-picker)

## Overview

Create a number-guessing game. The object is for the player to guess a random number within a fixed number of attempts. After each guess, a response on whether the random number is higher or lower will be provided until the player runs out of guesses. With each guess that is correct, the difficulty will increase.

> **The Challenge**

Create a game that allows a player to try and guess a random number within a certain number of guesses.
